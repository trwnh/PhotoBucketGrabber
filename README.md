you can do this natively on photobucket now i think, so this script is no longer necessary. also it was written years ago so it possibly (probably) doesn't work anymore

# PhotoBucketGrabber
Download all your photos from PhotoBucket using this Python script.

## Requirements
Python 3.4+, I think? Just use the latest Python 3 version.
Also, you'll have to manually edit line 33: https://github.com/trwnh/PhotoBucketGrabber/blob/master/grab.py#L33

## Instructions
### Get the direct URLs
1. Log in to your Photobucket account. Go to your "Library".

4. Click "Select all" at the top of your bucket. (This should add those photos to a black bar at the bottom.)

5. Navigate to each of your albums and click "Select all" to add them to the total selection.

8. Paste those links into a file called "photo.txt" in the same directory as the Python script. Save that file.

### Edit the script
9. Copy the prefix from any one of the URLs you just grabbed. Paste it into the variable `prefix` on line 33. The prefix is part of the URL up to and including your username and the trailing slash. https://github.com/trwnh/PhotoBucketGrabber/blob/master/grab.py#L33
10. Run `grab.py`.
11. Watch your photos get downloaded.
12. Feel free to delete your Photobucket account if the photos aren't linked anywhere live anymore.
